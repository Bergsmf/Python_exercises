# ![Link da imagem](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/gfg-gg-logo.svg) Geeks for geeks > Python challenges

This is just a repository for challenges that I did for practice and fun.

The exercises are available at this link: [Python Projects](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-projects-beginner-to-advanced/?ref=shm)

The sites provide the implementation on the exercise page, but I face this projects as a challenge, then I just read the text that explain what is needed to do.

I hope that in the future here will be many solutions with each more complex challenges.

Thank you
